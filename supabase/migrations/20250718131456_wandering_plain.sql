      - `client_name` (text) - client name
      - `client_id` (uuid) - reference to users table
      - `driver_name` (text) - driver name
      - `driver_id` (uuid) - reference to users table
      - `date` (text) - reservation date
      - `pickup` (text) - pickup address
      - `dropoff` (text) - dropoff address
      - `stops` (text[]) - intermediate stops
      - `status` (text) - reservation status
      - `status_history` (jsonb) - status change history
      - `amount` (numeric) - subtotal amount
      - `vat_amount` (numeric) - VAT amount
      - `total_amount` (numeric) - total amount
      - `driver_payout` (numeric) - driver payout
      - `payment_method` (text) - payment method
      - `service_tier_id` (uuid) - reference to service_tiers
      - `stripe_payment_id` (text) - Stripe payment ID
      - `passengers` (integer) - number of passengers
      - `suitcases` (integer) - number of suitcases

      - `duration` (text) - trip duration
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
